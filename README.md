This project focuses on analyzing employee salary data across various departments using SQL queries within a Jupyter notebook environment. The dataset, sourced from Kaggle's SF Salaries, contains the names, job title, and compensation for San Francisco city employees on an annual basis from 2011 to 2014.

Using SQL and Python with pandas, this project aims to explore and derive insights such as average salaries per department, salary distributions, top earners, and trends over time. By leveraging SQL queries, the project not only aims to uncover patterns in salary distributions.

First, we will import the necessary libraries for our project. We'll utilize sqlite3 to establish an in-memory SQLite database and pandas for efficient data manipulation. Our primary table of interest is named salaries. We will store our SQL queries in the query variable to facilitate seamless data exploration and analysis.
